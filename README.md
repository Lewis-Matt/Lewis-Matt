- 👋 Hi, I’m @misterlewis07
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end technologies, rapid prototyping, and the IoT.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic data structures and algorithms in python and JavaScript via FCC and CS50X (all of my submissions are in a private repo and I will commit to public when the course is completed).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mistermattlewis/
